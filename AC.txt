//This is where the admin password should be stored
//(dont worry it will be encrypted once the program is first launched and if you ever mess up,
//just wipe out the hex string and reenter your name and password in the following format):
//Note that you must input your username and password here and cannot simply hash your own combo online
//and dump the reuslts here since A) you do not know the hashing algorithm used and B) before even hashing,
//operations are performed on the user-pass combo to ensure greater security ;)

//format: !username:password

//For example: if my name was nathan and I wanted the password Java, I would write the following line: !nathan:Java
//This would cause the username nathan and a password of Java to allow for the admin panel to be accessed
