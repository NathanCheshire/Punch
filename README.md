# Punch
Punch is a time logging (punch card) program I wrote for my dad's Physical Therapy clinics to use. <br/>
I decided to clean up the project and publish it on GitHub and make a YouTube video documenting it's usage. <br/>
The program has a great deal of features to optimize an entrepreneur's payroll period if he/she has one.<br/>
See the YouTube video or documentation inside of the project for usage.<br/>
