# Punch
Punch is a time logging (punch card) program I wrote for my dad's Physical Therapy clinics to use. I decided to clean up the project and publish it on GitHub and make a YouTube video documenting it's usage. The program has a great deal of features to optimize an entrepreneur's payroll period if he/she has one.See the YouTube video or documentation inside of the project for usage: Video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnZ1-7sB2Bs&t=134s&ab_channel=NathanVincent
